# Practical programs for 7 languages in 7 weeks

This repo contains the exercises from the book 7 Languages in 7 Weeks.

The files will be split by week and day, if possible.

Started on Wednesday 13th of November, and will actually do a language every 2 weeks instead of every week. The "days" won't necessarily be a day each either.
